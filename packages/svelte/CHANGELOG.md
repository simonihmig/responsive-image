## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [#1563](https://github.com/simonihmig/responsive-image/pull/1563) [`06d9e9b`](https://github.com/simonihmig/responsive-image/commit/06d9e9bea0afd7b7d9e06827664f7a2946de04a2) Thanks [@wkillerud](https://github.com/wkillerud)! - Merges given class name instead of replacing internal classes

  Now you can give the React, Svelte and Solid components a custom class name without breaking the built-in styles or having to add `ri-img`, `ri-responsive` or `ri-fixed` yourself.

- Updated dependencies [[`d22c0fa`](https://github.com/simonihmig/responsive-image/commit/d22c0fac3f7c1bf03057745d802a9b58aa7075d9)]:

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#1239](https://github.com/simonihmig/responsive-image/pull/1239) [`2a12953`](https://github.com/simonihmig/responsive-image/commit/2a12953af08d22d5d9ba255c8a53025afd616a17) Thanks [@simonihmig](https://github.com/simonihmig)! - Refactor internal LQIP implementation

  The way the build plugins would expose the image meta data for any LQIP (Low Quality Image Placeholder) features has changed, especially related to Thumbhash/Blurhash. Previously, the image component would lazily load the runtime decoding function for Thumbhash/Blurhash (dynamic import), as to not load that code when the feature is not used at all. However, this introduced some (minor) delay due to the additional chunk loading, but also made the internal implementation of the image components more complex than it needed to be due to having to handle asynchrony. Now the conditional loading is off-loaded to the build plugins, which can make the decision to pull in the decoding code only when needed at build-time, significantly simplifying the runtime image components by removing any async loading and state syncing.

  This changed the internal contract (interface) for the LQIP feature between the build plugins (Vite or webpack) and the image components. This is a breaking chance, but the only impact for users is to make sure you only use v2.x of any of the project's dependencies (`@responsive-image/*`). No changes in code required.

  This changed the interface between build plugins and image components with regard to how CSS styling information for LQIP options is passed through. While technically a breaking change, this shouldn't affect you as long as you are on V2.x versions of any build blugins _and_ image component packages.

  It also introduces a new `styles: 'inline'` option for build plugins to ship LQIP tyles in the JavaScript bundle, which is needed for the web component, as external styles (external CSS file) was actually not working before due to Shadow DOM isolation.
