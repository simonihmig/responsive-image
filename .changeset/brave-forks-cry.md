Introduce new `@responsive-image/wc` package for Lit-based web component support

This package exposes a browser native [Web Component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components#specifications). It is implemented using the [Lit](https://lit.dev/) library, but it can be used with any other [framework supporting web components](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/), or none at all.
