## Usage

This package provides several webpack loaders for specific aspects of image processing and transforming an import of an image into an ES module whose exported value you can pass to the `<ResponsiveImage/>` component.

The easiest and recommended way to set these up is to use the provided `setupLoaders` utility function:

```js
const { setupLoaders } = require('@responsive-image/webpack');
```

The function will return an array of loaders (so called chained loaders), that you can `use` to set up a webpack module rule. In your webpack config file (`webpack.config.js`) add such a module rule that tells webpack to use the provided loaders for importing images:

```js
const { setupLoaders } = require('@responsive-image/webpack');

const config = {
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  // ...
  module: {
    rules: [
      // other rules...
      {
        resourceQuery: /responsive/,
        use: setupLoaders(),
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

> [!TIP]
> While you could define the module rule to use our webpack loader for all kind of image imports, we recommend preserving the ability to import images using webpack's built-in [asset modules](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-modules/) if all you need is the image URL. When following the example config above, you would opt-in to responsive image processing only when importing using a `?responsive` query parameter, like `import image from './assets/hero.jpg?responsive';`.

## Configuration

### Global configuration

The package comes with reasonable defaults, but if you want to customize these for all image imports globally, then you can pass an optional configuration object to `setupLoaders()`:

```js
setupLoaders({
  w: [1024, 2048],
  format: ['original', 'avif'],
});
```

### Query params

Besides global settings, you can also pass all the supported configuration options as query parameters when importimng an image:

```js
import logo from './logo.jpg?&w=32;64&quality=95&responsive';
```

Query params alwas take precedence of global settings passed to `setupLoaders()`.
