# @responsive-image/cdn

## 1.0.0-beta.3

### Major Changes

- [#737](https://github.com/simonihmig/responsive-image/pull/737) [`55c502c`](https://github.com/simonihmig/responsive-image/commit/55c502c7da6e0fe86e0ffb2c5ec2f3d39e82679d) Thanks [@simonihmig](https://github.com/simonihmig)! - Refactor the way to set config

  The `ember` package does not read from `config/addons.js` anymore. Instead an explicit runtime call to `setConfig()` is needed, same as for the `wc` package. The `cdn` package reads its config from the `cdn` namespace.

### Patch Changes

## 1.0.0-beta.2

### Major Changes

- [#614](https://github.com/simonihmig/responsive-image/pull/614) [`2d10626`](https://github.com/simonihmig/responsive-image/commit/2d10626daca68fa97c6566bb5203e9861f1dadff) Thanks [@simonihmig](https://github.com/simonihmig)! - Use Record-based API for cloudinary transformations

  Instead of passing cloudinary transformations as a string according to the Cloudinary Transformation URL API, you need to pass them as an object. If you want to use chained transformations, pass an array of objects.

  ```js
  // using @resposive-image/cdn
  const simpleTransformation = cloudinaryProvider('foo/bar.jpg', {
    transformations: { co: 'rgb:20a020', e: 'colorize:50' },
  });

  const chainedTransformation = cloudinaryProvider('foo/bar.jpg', {
    transformations: [
      { co: 'rgb:20a020', e: 'colorize:50' },
      { ar: '1.0', c: 'fill', w: '150' },
      { r: 'max' },
    ],
  });
  ```

  ```hbs
  {{!-- using @responsive-image/ember }}
  <ResponsiveImage
    @src={{responsiveImageCloudinaryProvider
      "foo/bar.jpg"
      transformations=(hash co="rgb:20a020" e="colorize:50")
    }}
  >
  ```
