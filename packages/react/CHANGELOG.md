# @responsive-image/react

## 1.1.3

### Patch Changes

- [#1662](https://github.com/simonihmig/responsive-image/pull/1662) [`ca440a9`](https://github.com/simonihmig/responsive-image/commit/ca440a9069f373cafca2aa79428c34d02aab2dc4) Thanks [@simonihmig](https://github.com/simonihmig)! - Fix LQIP reactivity when src changes

  When changing the `src` argument dynamically, the loading state was not correctly reset. This is fixing it, so that the new image's LQIP styles get applied while it is loading.

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- [#1584](https://github.com/simonihmig/responsive-image/pull/1584) [`6746123`](https://github.com/simonihmig/responsive-image/commit/6746123bd971fcc033f8350cefe16ed4b5c1f54e) Thanks [@wkillerud](https://github.com/wkillerud)! - Map LQIP styles to React format

  Fixes a warning about unsupported style properties when using CSS attribute names with dashes. The React component now maps CSS attributes to the camelCase React expects.

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#1563](https://github.com/simonihmig/responsive-image/pull/1563) [`06d9e9b`](https://github.com/simonihmig/responsive-image/commit/06d9e9bea0afd7b7d9e06827664f7a2946de04a2) Thanks [@wkillerud](https://github.com/wkillerud)! - Merges given class name instead of replacing internal classes

  Now you can give the React, Svelte and Solid components a custom class name without breaking the built-in styles or having to add `ri-img`, `ri-responsive` or `ri-fixed` yourself.

### Minor Changes

- [#1408](https://github.com/simonihmig/responsive-image/pull/1408) [`04979f8`](https://github.com/simonihmig/responsive-image/commit/04979f823085a1894219e7070f79138fca0e7558) Thanks [@wkillerud](https://github.com/wkillerud)! - Export the CSS as well as a JS only variant

  Most of the time the default export should "just work", but this change adds some flexibility for users of the package.

  In particular it makes it easier to include the CSS in a client-side bundle in an application that is otherwise server-side only.
