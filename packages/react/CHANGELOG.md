# @responsive-image/react

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1408](https://github.com/simonihmig/responsive-image/pull/1408) [`04979f8`](https://github.com/simonihmig/responsive-image/commit/04979f823085a1894219e7070f79138fca0e7558) Thanks [@wkillerud](https://github.com/wkillerud)! - Export the CSS as well as a JS only variant

  Most of the time the default export should "just work", but this change adds some flexibility for users of the package.

  In particular it makes it easier to include the CSS in a client-side bundle in an application that is otherwise server-side only.
