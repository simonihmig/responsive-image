# Getting started

To get started, install at least the package for your [frontend framework](../frameworks/index.md), and if you want to process [local images](../usage/local-images.md) one of the [build plugins](../build/index.md). Please refer to the linked guides for more detailed instructions!

For example, if you use Ember.js and webpack, then install these packages:

::: code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @responsive-image/ember @responsive-image/webpack
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @responsive-image/ember @responsive-image/webpack
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @responsive-image/ember @responsive-image/webpack
```

:::

Now let's dive a bit deeper into the [core concepts](../usage/concepts.md) for responsive images!
