# Frontend frameworks

The [image component](../usage/component.md) and other utilities are provided with framework specific packages:

- [Ember](./ember.md)
- [React](./react.md)
- [Solid](./solid.md)
- [Svelte](./svelte.md)
- [Web Component](./wc.md) (built with Lit, but usable with any framework)

> [!NOTE]
> Multi-framework support is still WIP. More supported frameworks will be added here over time...
